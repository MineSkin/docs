The MineSkin API V2 introduces some changes to how skins are generated. This guide will outline the most important changes to help you migrate to the new endpoints.


## Try V2 Now

To try out the new API without making changes to your existing code, you can enable the compatibility layer on V1 endpoints. This will act as a proxy to the new API and its features while retaining the old request and response format.<br/>
To enable the compatibility, pass `?v2=true` as a query parameter on the `/generate` endpoints. Alternatively you can enable compatibility for all requests made by your API key in the [API key settings](https://account.mineskin.org/keys).


## Migrate to V2

* For the most basic migration, simply exchange <CustomMethodEndpoint method={ "POST" } path={ "/generate/upload" }/> (or /url, /user)
with <a href="/docs/mineskin-api/generate-a-skin"><CustomMethodEndpoint method={ "POST" } path={ "/v2/generate" }/></a>
* If you use custom visibility settings, make sure to exchange the IDs with strings so `public` instead of `0` and `unlisted` instead of `1`.
* Note: if you also still use the legacy skin model names, those need to be either `classic` or `slim` in V2 (or simply omit it to automatically detect the variant).
* Finally, adjust your response parsing to use the new JSON structure - see the comparison in [V2 Changes](./v2-changes).
* **Most importantly**, skin value and signature is moved from `data.texture.value` to `skin.texture.data.value`.
See [`POST /v2/generate`](/docs/mineskin-api/generate-a-skin) for details.
<br/>


* To also make use of the new queue system, make the request and response changes above but adjust your code to first call POST [`POST /v2/queue`](/docs/mineskin-api/queue-skin-generation)
and then check [`GET /queue/:jobId`](/docs/mineskin-api/get-job-status) once every few seconds until the job is `completed` (or `failed`).
* Note: if you queue a lot of jobs, you can also use the `GET /queue` endpoint to list all jobs and their status to avoid getting rate-limited.
