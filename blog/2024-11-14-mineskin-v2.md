**Today I am happy to announce the MineSkin API V2!**   
This update brings improvements in speed, reliability, and API response consistency, along with a new website experience. MineSkin V2 represents a full overhaul of the skin data generation process and MineSkin's infrastructure.

<!-- truncate -->

**Here’s what’s new:**


## New Website
The website has been **completely rebuilt** to feel more intuitive and to support the new API features.  
It’s currently in beta at [v2.mineskin.org](https://v2.mineskin.org) and will replace the current site once it’s ready.  
**Please share any feedback** or report issues via the [MineSkin Discord](https://discord.gg/DeeNu3cUMp)—it’s super helpful to know what works and what could be improved!

Also, if you haven’t seen it, I’ve launched a new [Account Manager](https://account.mineskin.org/) to make it easier to manage your API keys, linked Minecraft accounts, and more.


## API Changes

tl;dr: Read the [API documentation](/docs/mineskin-api/mineskin-api) or check out the [migration guide](/docs/guides/migrating-to-v2) for an overview of the changes.

### Unified `/generate` Endpoint
I’ve streamlined the old `/generate/upload`, `/generate/url`, and `/generate/user` requests into a single, simplified `/v2/generate` endpoint. It will automatically detect what you want to generate based on the content you provide.

### Generator Queue
In MineSkin V1, requests were processed immediately, which could lead to **slow response times** (up to five seconds for some requests). Now, requests are added to a **global queue** managed by several worker instances. While you can still use `/generate`, I recommend the new `POST /v2/queue`, which returns either the existing skin data or a job UUID to track your request via `GET /v2/queue/:jobId`.  
*(I may add webhook support if there’s enough interest in it!)*

### True Private Skin Data
Previously, private skins were more “unlisted” than actually private, just excluded from the gallery and skin list. Now, skins can be **truly private**—only accessible through your API key and listed on the ["My Skins"](https://v2.mineskin.org/my-skins) page.

### Relaxed Rate Limits
With the new queue system, I’ve been able to **relax the rate limits**. Instead of a fixed delay between requests, you can submit multiple requests at once, which will process as queue spots open. Each user has a limit of **five requests** in the queue at a time.

### Credits System
To improve queue management, MineSkin V2 now operates on a credit system: Each new skin generation uses one credit. You’ll receive 100 free credits per month plus 10 credits daily.

If you use up your credits, you can still generate skins, but requests are given **lower priority**. Here’s how to get more:


### Extra Credits and Subscriptions
In the [last post](./2024-07-14-anniversary-and-future), I mentioned the need to help cover server costs to keep MineSkin free for most users. **Thanks to everyone who provided feedback!**

Here’s the new setup: **MineSkin remains free** for most users. Monthly and daily credits should cover about 90% of users’ needs. I’ve also introduced [subscriptions](https://account.mineskin.org/store) for those who want **extra credits, ad-free browsing, private skin generation, early access to features,** and **faster concurrent generation**. For anyone who needs extra flexibility, you can purchase [additional credits](https://account.mineskin.org/store) as needed.

I’m excited to bring more options in the future, like **skin data with capes, auto-retries,** and **private Minecraft account pools** for premium users. For now, though, I’d love to hear your thoughts on these changes. I’m open to making adjustments based on your feedback!
