Credits for skin generation are being removed to simplify the system and reduce confusion.
**Credits were never required to generate skins**, but they were originally introduced as a way to prioritize requests.
In practice, priority wasn’t often needed, making the system more complicated than necessary.  

### **What’s changing?**  
- **Credits will no longer be used for skin generation.** Instead, free users will have a base rate limit, and subscriptions will provide higher limits.  
- **Free users now have a slightly increased limit of 20 skins per minute.**  
- **One-time boosts will be introduced** for users who want temporary rate increases without subscribing.  
- **Subscription plans have been adjusted** to offer more flexibility at different price points.  

### **Will my request speed change without credits?**  
No, request speed will always be as fast as possible for your plan. 
Previously, credits were meant to prioritize requests, but in most cases, there wasn’t much of a queue, so requests were already processed quickly. 
Now, **speed is determined solely by your subscription plan**, without credits affecting it.  

### **What happens to account reward credits?**  
Credits earned from linking Minecraft accounts won’t go to waste. 
The plan is to allow them to be used for **store discounts or temporary rate boosts** instead. More details on this will be announced soon.  

### **Will subscriptions change?**  
Existing subscriptions will continue as usual. If you’re already subscribed, your pricing will stay the same unless you change plans.  

### **What about previously purchased credits?**  
Anyone with unused purchased credits can request **a refund** or exchange them for a discount on a subscription plan.  

### **Why are credits being removed?**  
The goal is to make MineSkin more intuitive. 
Since credits weren’t necessary for prioritization most of the time, moving to a simpler system with clear rate limits makes things easier to understand and use.
